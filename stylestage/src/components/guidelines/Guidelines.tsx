            Contributing a stylesheet to Style Stage means you agree to abide by

          <h3>TL;DR</h3>
          <p>
            All submissions will be autoprefixed and prepended with the
            <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">
              CC BY-NC-SA license
            </a>
            as well as attribution using the metadata you provide. You may use
            any build setup you prefer, but the final submission should be the
            compiled, unminified CSS. You retain the copyright to original
            graphics and must ensure all graphics used are appropriately
            licensed. All asset links, including fonts, must be absolute to
            external resources. Stylesheets will be saved into the Github repo,
            and detected changes that violate the guidelines are cause for
            removal.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ensure your design is responsive, and that it passes accessible
            contrast (we'll be using aXe to verify). Animations should be
            removed via `prefers-reduced-motion`. Cutting-edge techniques should
            come with a fallback if needed to not severely impact the user
            experience. No content may be permanently hidden, and hidden items
            must come with an accessible viewing technique. Page load time
            should not exceed 3 seconds.
          </p>
